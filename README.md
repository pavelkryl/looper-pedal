# looper-emulator
Looper emulator is a free linux application which should make creating music as easy as a looper pedal or a loop station.

## Why?
I wanted an app which:
- is free,
- is simple and intuitive to use,
- allows you to create music live and on your own.

Looper emulator aims for smoothness of use. Moreover, it prioritizes A GUI that is quick to understand over the amount of features.
