            This function contains the core logic of the audio manipulation and user event handling.

            Firstly, it checks for output underflow - a state where the outdata are not supplied quickly enough.
            In case of output underflow the output is dropped (filled with zeros) in order to compensate for the underflow.
            However, this delays the handling of user events and could result in an unpleasant recording/listening experience.

            Secondly, the user events are handled. Theoratically, only one event can be handled in one callback call,
            however in normal usage of the looper emulator the events are not expected to come nowhere near this capacity.
            On a START recording event the data from the last beat buffer are taken as a base for the recorded track, 
            and the recording flag is raised in order to store (record) the indata in further calls to callback 
            (until the recording is finished). If another start event comes before an old recording could be finished,
            the old recording is discarded and replaced by the new one.
            If a STOP recording event comes in the first half of a beat, the remaining frames of the last beat are filled 
            with zeros and the recording is finished. If the event comes in the second half of a beat, the rest of this beat
            is recorded and the recording is finished afterwards.
